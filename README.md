# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation is a way of dividing the customers into groups that share similar characteristics. The data-set chosen is extracted from the Machine learning repository. This implementation uses many different approaches to classify customers into different categories-Frequent customers, Infrequent customers, Good customers, low value customers, high value customers, champion customers-after preprocessing the extracted data. Analysis of different classifiers used and their pros and cons is presented in this paper. The main purpose of this analysis is to help the business better understand its customers and therefore conduct customer-centric marketing more effectively.
